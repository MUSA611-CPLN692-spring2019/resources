## Submitting Weekly Assignments with git and GitHub

### Beginning to end process for each week:


#### 1. [Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the course organization's weekly repo from `https://github.com/MUSA611-CPLN692-spring2019/cpln692-weekX` :

#### 2. Open up the command line (mac terminal, windows PowerShell, etc)

Navigate to a location on your computer where you want to clone the repo locally, *I'd recommend you create a folder in a location that will become standard for each week*
I.e **/Users/rbernet/penn/cpln692**

#### 3. Type in the command:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rossbernet/cpln-weekX
```

**Make sure you are cloning your personal fork and not the course organizations repo**

#### 4. Open that directory in atom.
If you have [atom shell tool](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8103418/51787571-c26c9e80-2141-11e9-973f-d7e308c27a15.png) installed you can type:

```bash
$ cd cpln692-weekX
$ atom .

```

#### 5. Do the assignment.
Save it.

#### 6. Committing and pushing changes with git
Make sure you are in the weekly assignment's directory in the terminal. You can confirm this by viewing the pre-staged changes git is tracking by typing in: `git status` You should see something [like this.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8103418/51787614-12e3fc00-2142-11e9-8ef9-e2a340971a39.png)

This sequence of git commands will allow you to push the updates from your local copy to your remote personal repo:

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE"
$ git push
```
*(git may ask for your GitHub password after the `git push` command)*


#### **7. Creating a Pull Request to the Class's Organization Repo:**

In Chrome, go to your forked copy on your GitHub repo. You should see something like:
